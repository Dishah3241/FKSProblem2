# FKS Problem 2: a graph or its complement on 2d+1 vertices embeds in R^d

The proof sibling. Unlike its statement module this may import the development, and it is the one
explicit exception to the standalone isolation rule.

`lake exe proof-links` requires, for every closed proposition `C` in the statement module, a
theorem named `C.proof` whose type is exactly `C` applied to the statement's own parameter
telescope. Renaming or deleting one fails the audit.

Each proof opens with `change`, spelling out the proposition it discharges. That keeps the proof
readable without chasing the definition, and it fails loudly if the statement moves underneath it.
`unfold` before `decide` is required because instance synthesis does not see through a `def`, even
an exposed one.
