# Audit statement fidelity

`lake build` rejects `sorry`. `lake exe axioms` rejects every axiom outside the permitted three.
Neither notices that a theorem is *vacuously true*, that a hypothesis is *decorative*, or that a
definition does not mean what its name says. Those are the defects an expert review still finds in
a mechanically clean AI formalization (arXiv 2606.13925), and they are exactly the defects a
reviewer who reads Lean but not mathematical prose cannot catch by reading.

This audit makes the authoring obligations for those defects mechanical. For every closed
proposition `C` in a reader-facing statement module it requires:

* `C.witness` — evidence that `C`'s hypotheses can be jointly satisfied. A theorem whose
  hypotheses are unsatisfiable is true and proves nothing.

* `C.drop<Tag>` — for each non-dependent `Prop`-valued binder `h` of `C`'s body, a companion
  whose body is definitionally `¬ C'`, where `C'` is `C` with that binder removed. `<Tag>` is
  the binder's user name, split on `_`, with each segment capitalized and the segments joined,
  or its 0-based index in the telescope when the binder is anonymous, left as digits. Thus
  `hdim` gives `dropHdim`, `h_dim` gives `dropHDim`, and index `2` gives `drop2`. A hypothesis
  written with `→` is anonymous: Lean stores it under a hygienic name. A binder is dependent
  when a later binder's type or the conclusion mentions it. Those cannot be removed, so the
  audit skips them and prints that. The proof `C.drop<Tag>.proof`, in the proof sibling, is
  the kernel-checked counterexample.

and for every definition `D` in such a module:

* `D.separating` — a nondegenerate example distinguishing `D` from the nearest plausible wrong
  definition. Compilation does not establish that `IsRegular` means regular.

A witness or separating example must mention the declaration it is about, and must not be `True`.
That catches the obvious way to satisfy this audit without doing the work:
`theorem C.witness : True := trivial`. A drop companion is not checked that way. Definitional
equality with `¬ C'` is the check, and that negation may itself be `True`.

What this audit does *not* do: derive the witness, or try to prove the negation of `C`. Negation
stays human-directed, per `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` stage 1.

Run after `lake build`.

/-- What a companion actually asserts.

A companion is written `def C.witness : Prop := ...`, so its *type* is the bare `Prop` and carries
no information. The assertion lives in the body. Reading the type instead of the body was the
original defect here, and `lake exe fidelity` caught it on this repository's own example. -/

/-- The companion must be *about* its subject. It counts as about the subject when it names the
subject directly, or when it shares a locally declared constant with the subject's own assertion.

The second clause is not slack, it is the common case: a satisfiability witness for
`∀ x, H x → C x` exhibits an `x` satisfying `H`, and so names `H` rather than the claim. Requiring
the claim's own name would reject exactly the right shape. Sharing is restricted to constants
declared in the statement modules, because sharing `Finset` or `Nat` with the subject would make
the check vacuous.

This rejects a companion about something else entirely. It does not certify that the companion is
the *right* evidence, which no check here can do; that stays on the semantic-review list. -/
