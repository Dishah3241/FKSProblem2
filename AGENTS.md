# FKSProblem2 working rules

`README.md` states the target and the current stage. The Math workspace's `AGENTS.md` holds the
workspace rules and governs here too — read it first. It is `~/Code/Math/AGENTS.md`: use that
absolute path, because `../../AGENTS.md` resolves only from the primary checkout, not from a
worktree. `~/Code/Math/docs/PLAYBOOK.md` holds the pipeline. This file
covers only what is specific to a Lean project repository.

## Mathematical standard

- Lean is the authority for what is proved. State exact quantifiers, ambient hypotheses, zero and
  degenerate cases, inequality direction, and equality orientation.
- Use established terminology in declaration names, statements, docstrings, and the blueprint.
  `blueprint/terminology/FIELD.md` records this project's vocabulary and its sources.
- Follow Mathlib spelling in module paths, declaration names, and API references. Reader-facing
  prose follows the field map; cited titles stay verbatim.
- A theorem attributed to a source retains every mathematically relevant source hypothesis. A
  stronger generalization is a separate declaration, identified as such.
- Validate a new definition with characteristic lemmas and a separating example distinguishing it
  from the nearest plausible wrong definition. **Compilation is not fidelity.**
- Search pinned Mathlib before introducing a definition or a substantial proof. Reuse its
  namespace, notation, theorem shape, and API where the mathematics agrees. Never edit a pinned
  dependency in place.
- No declaration under `FKSProblem2/` may use `sorry`, directly or transitively. The only admitted
  axioms are `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`, enforced by `lake exe axioms`. The
  root `Challenge.lean` may contain only its advertised hole.

## Architecture

Modules are organized by mathematical object. General mathematics mirrors Mathlib's top-level
areas: `Algebra/`, `Analysis/`, `Combinatorics/`, `Data/`, `FieldTheory/`, `LinearAlgebra/`,
`NumberTheory/`, `Order/`, `RingTheory/`, `SetTheory/`, `Topology/`. The project's own spine lives
in its own subdirectories, listed in order in `subjectRoots` in `scripts/Layering.lean`.

Imports run from general mathematics towards the subject. `Examples/`, `Standalone/`, and local
`Tests/` are leaves. `Tests/` holds compiled clients of nearby public APIs; `Examples/` holds
mathematics worth reading. `lake exe layering` enforces this.

Every file uses the module system: begin with `module`, `public import` exactly when an imported
name occurs in an exported type, and put exported declarations in a `public section`. Import the
module that directly provides each name. `lake build` is authoritative because the `FKSProblem2.*`
glob compiles every source file, so an orphaned module still fails.

Keep pinned Lean and Mathlib revisions fixed during a mathematical change. A dependency update is
its own reviewed change.

## Statement entry points

Top-level files in `FKSProblem2/Standalone/Mathlib/` are claims meant to be read by a mathematician
as single files. `InlineFKSProblem2.lean` is the Palomar statement source: **`Challenge.lean` is
generated from it** by `scripts/check-palomar-challenge.sh --update`, as its prefix up to the
closing proof-link note plus `scripts/palomar-challenge-footer.txt`. Never hand-edit
`Challenge.lean`; edit the source and regenerate. CI fails when the two diverge, so statement
drift is prevented by construction rather than by discipline.

- A claim file states a substantive result in immediately recognizable language. A reader must not
  need to follow a project definition to decide what it says: inline the relevant predicate or give
  an exact elementary characterization in the file.
- Keep narration short. Docstrings describe the object or conclusion, never implementation history,
  proof status, or editorial plans.
- A sibling `FooProof.lean` supplies the proof of every closed proposition in `Foo.lean`. Move
  unrelated machinery to `Support/`.
- Statement files import **only Mathlib**. Proof siblings are the explicit exception.
- Every closed proposition carries a `.witness`; every definition carries a `.separating`.
  Every non-dependent `Prop` hypothesis of a closed proposition also carries a `.drop<Tag>`
  companion. `<Tag>` is the binder's name with each `_`-separated segment capitalized (`hdim`
  gives `dropHdim`), or its telescope index when the binder is anonymous (`drop2`); Mathlib's
  `defsWithUnderscore` linter rejects an underscore. See
  `InlineFKSProblem2.lean` for what each must actually accomplish. `lake exe fidelity` checks
  that witnesses and separating examples exist, are about their subject, and are not `True`, and
  that each drop companion is definitionally the negation of the claim with that hypothesis
  removed. It cannot check that a witness or a separating example is *good*, which is why those
  two stay on the semantic-review list.

Enforced by `lake exe standalone-mathlib`, `lake exe proof-links`, and `lake exe fidelity`.

## Lean style

- Keep public definition bodies opaque. Provide the characteristic, membership, coercion,
  evaluation, extensionality, and operation lemmas downstream clients need.
- Do not rely on accidental definitional equality across modules. Add a public eliminator or pass
  explicit data.
- Test public interfaces in separately compiled `Tests/` clients, including zero, degenerate, and
  nondegenerate cases where they distinguish the intended semantics.
- Prefer dependency-native notation and dot notation. Introduce syntax only for a repeated
  mathematical distinction.
- Follow Mathlib formatting, lines at most 100 characters. Do not weaken warnings or linters. A
  `@[nolint]` requires a mathematical justification and an allowlist entry.

## Workflow

1. Fix the intended statement and search the pinned dependencies.
2. Prototype uncertain mathematics in `tmp/`; keep `tmp/` empty at committed checkpoints.
3. Move only typechecked work into its semantic module, with the smallest meaningful client.
4. Run focused checks while iterating. Before a green checkpoint run every gate in
   `~/Code/Math/AGENTS.md`.
5. When you change an audit, extend `scripts/audit-probes.sh` so the checker must reject a
   representative bad input and name that probe.
6. Inspect the exact diff and commit one coherent change. Do not stage unrelated work.

A direct one-file check must pass the package options explicitly:

```text
lake env lean -DautoImplicit=false -DrelaxedAutoImplicit=false FILE.lean
```
